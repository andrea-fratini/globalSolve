# globalSolve

The globalSolve package provides functions to solve DSGE models by means of (global) projection methods, the solution strategies already implemented are:
  - Tensorial Chebyshev polynomials (for smooth problems with a reduced number of exogenous processes)
  - Triangular basis (for models with non-linearities introduced by inequality constraints)
  - Asintropic grids (for models with a large amount of exogenous processes)
